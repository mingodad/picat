There are several make files in the fold "emu/" for
different platforms. To make the executable for a
platform, simply run the command

make -f Makefile***

For example, for MacOS, type

make -f Makefile.mac64

The interface between Picat and SCIP, which is supported
for Linux and MacOS, is not included in the default make
files. To make Picat including the SCIP interface, type

sh make_picat_scip_linux

or

sh make_picat_scip_mac
